  Ideas to add to project

  - Use a third method to classify 2 numbers that are hardest to distinguish

  - Plot training errors and generalization errors with different params like
  how many dimensions I keep, PCA, or number of neighbors... explain the
  curve. like more dimension, less accurate, but than too few dimension
  =\<gtr\> information loss less accurate as well
